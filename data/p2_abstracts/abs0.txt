Objectives: Cervical cancer can often be cured by surgery alone, if diagnosed and
treated early. However, of the cancer patients who live in the world's poorest
countries less that 5% have access to safe, effective and timely cancer surgery. 
We designed a novel, competency-based curriculum to rapidly build surgical
capacity for the treatment of cervical cancer. Here we report experiences and
early outcomes of its implementation in Malawi.
Methods: Curriculum implementation consisted of preoperative evaluation of
patients and surgical video review, discussion of surgical instruments and suture
material, deconstruction of the surgical procedure into critical subcomponents
including trainees walking through the steps of the procedure with the master
trainers, high-volume surgical repetition over a short time interval,
intra-operative mentoring, post-operative case review, and mental narration. This
was preceded by self-directed learning and followed by clinical mentorship
through electronic communication and quarterly on-site visits.
Results: Between June 2015-June 2017, 28 patients underwent radical abdominal
hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The first 8 surgeries were
performed over 5â€¯days. After the 7th case the trainee could perform the procedure
alone. During and between quarterly mentoring-visits the trainee independently
performed the procedure on 20 additional patients. Major surgical complications
were rare.
Conclusions: Life-saving surgical treatment for cervical cancer is now available 
for the first time, as a routine clinical service, in Central/Northern, Malawi.
