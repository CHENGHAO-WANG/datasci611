Background: To our knowledge, no published studies utilizing a randomized
controlled design have examined the efficacy of patient navigation for improving 
clinical trial enrollment.
Methods: This patient navigation and clinical trial participation study is a
randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a patient navigator on
enrollment into therapeutic cancer clinical trials. Participants are randomly
assigned to high intensity, patient navigator-delivered patient educational
materials (PEM) and needs assessment vs. low intensity patient navigation
(patient navigator-delivered patient educational materials [PEM] alone).
Discussion: Effective enrollment strategies may include utilization of patient
navigators as away to meet individual needs, barriers, and concerns of
participants enrolled in clinical trials.
