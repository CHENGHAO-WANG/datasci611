To describe autoantibodies (Abs) against tripartite motif-containing (TRIM)
protein 9 and 67 in two patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
(PCD) associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Abs were characterized using
immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, cultures of murine cortical, and
hippocampal neurons, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, knockout mice for
Trim9 and 67, and cell-based assay. Control samples included sera from 63
patients with small cell lung cancer without any paraneoplastic neurological
syndrome, 36 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and PNS, CSF from 100 patients
with autoimmune encephalitis, and CSF from 165 patients with neurodegenerative
diseases. We found Abs targeting TRIM9 and TRIM67 at high concentration in the
serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a 78-year-old woman and a 65-year-old 
man. Both developed subacute severe cerebellar ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance
imaging found no abnormality and no cerebellar atrophy. Both had CSF inflammation
with mild pleiocytosis and a few oligoclonal bands. We identified a pulmonary
adenocarcinoma, confirming the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome in both
patients. They received immunomodulatory and cancer treatments without
improvement of cerebellar ataxia, even though both were in remission of their
cancer (for more than 10 years in one patient). Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs
were specific to these two patients. All control serum and CSF samples tested
were negative for anti-TRIM9 and 67. Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs appeared to
be specific biomarkers of PCD and should be added to the panel of antigens tested
when this is suspected.
