In 2017, due to a fluid shortage secondary to Hurricane Maria's devastation of
Puerto Rico, hospitals and health-systems began to substitute rolapitant for
fosaprepitant as part of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prevention and 
treatment strategies. However, despite advantageous pharmacologic and formulation
(e.g. long half-life, quicker time to onset, and lack of first-pass hepatic
metabolism) profiles, there seems to be significant risk of infusion-related
hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of intravenous
rolapitant. In January 2018, the U.S. FDA issued a Health Care Provider Letter
stating that anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, and other serious hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Importantly, these
reactions were observed at a higher rate than initially reported in the phase 1
bioequivalence study that led to FDA approval of intravenous rolapitant (2.8%),
with many resulting in hospitalizations. At our institution, rolapitant-induced
infusion-related reactions also occurred in more patients than expected (8.7%).
Described herein are six cases of infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions
with intravenous rolapitant at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital. Due to the
quick onset of the infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions with intravenous
rolapitant, interpatient differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are 
unlikely to be the cause. An objective assessment utilizing the Naranjo Causality
Scale rates these infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions as definite adverse
drug reactions.
