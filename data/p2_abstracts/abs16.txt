A standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linear
models. We describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broad 
class of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidence
intervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembled 
and events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected on
explanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just for
individuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohort
members enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design is
that this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of several
outcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data may
allow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-response
analyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive and
others multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due to
interaction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as well 
as stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used to
illustrate these methods.
