PURPOSE: To investigate the implications of a cancer diagnosis on medication
adherence for pre-existing comorbid conditions, we explored statin adherence
patterns prior to and following a new diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or
prostate cancer among a multi-ethnic cohort.
METHODS: We identified adults enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Northern California
who were prevalent statin medication users, newly diagnosed with breast,
colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. Statin adherence was
measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the 2-year pre-cancer 
diagnosis and the 2-year post-cancer diagnosis. Adherence patterns were assessed 
using generalized estimating equations, for all cancers combined and stratified
by cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and tumor 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 10,177 cancer patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- to
post-cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI):0.88-0.94). Statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer
diagnosis among breast (ORadj:0.94, 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79,
95% CI:0.74-0.85) cancer patients. No difference in adherence was observed among 
prostate cancer patients (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97-1.05). Prior to cancer
diagnosis, adherence to statins was generally higher among non-Hispanic whites
and multi-race patients than other groups. However, statin adherence after
diagnosis decreased only among these two populations (ORadj:0.85, 95%
CI:0.85-0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76-0.97), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial variation in statin medication adherence
following diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large cohort of
prevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Improving our understanding of comorbidity
management and polypharmacy across diverse cancer patient populations is
warranted to develop tailored interventions that improve medication adherence and
reduce disparities in health outcomes.
