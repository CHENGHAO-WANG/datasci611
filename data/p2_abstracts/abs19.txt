The Cancer/Testes (CT) Antigen HORMAD1 is germ cell-restricted and plays
developmental roles in generation and processing of meiotic DNA Double Strand
Breaks (DSB). Many tumors aberrantly overexpress HORMAD1 yet the potential impact
of this CT antigen on cancer biology is unclear. We tested a potential role of
HORMAD1 in genome maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We show that HORMAD1 
re-distributes to nuclear foci and co-localizes with the DSB marker γH2AX in
response to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic agents. The HORMA domain
and C-term disordered oligomerization motif are necessary for localization of
HORMAD1 to IR-induced foci (IRIF). HORMAD1-depleted cells are sensitive to IR and
camptothecin. In reporter assays, Homologous Recombination (HR)-mediated repair
of targeted ISce1-induced DSBs is attenuated in HORMAD1-depleted cells. In
Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) reporter assays, HORMAD1-depletion does not
affect repair of ISce1-induced DSB. Early DSB signaling events (including ATM
phosphorylation and formation of γH2AX, 53BP1 and NBS1 foci) are intact in
HORMAD1-depleted cells. However, generation of RPA-ssDNA foci and redistribution 
of RAD51 to DSB are compromised in HORMAD1-depleted cells, suggesting that
HORMAD1 promotes DSB resection. HORMAD1-mediated HR is a neomorphic activity that
is independent of its meiotic partners (including HORMAD2 and CCDC36.
Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data show that similar to known HR pathway genes
HORMAD1 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of HR genes is
associated with specific mutational profiles (including copy number variation).
Taken together, we identify HORMAD1-dependent DSB repair as a new mechanism of
radioresistance and a probable determinant of mutability in lung adenocarcinoma.
