BACKGROUND: Recreational physical activity has been consistently associated with 
reduced breast cancer risk. Less is known about how family history of breast
cancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.
METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister with
breast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported all
recreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12
months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered in
association with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,
examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporating
characteristics of the family structure.
RESULTS: During follow-up (average 8.4 years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higher
hours/week (HR>=7vs<1=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) and MET-hours/week
(HRquartile4vs1=0.75; 95%CI: 0.67-0.85) of physical activity were associated with
reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week were
associated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk
(MET-hours/week HRquartile4vs1=1.25; 95%CI: 0.98-1.60). Associations did not vary
with extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal women
may be limited to those with stronger family history.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activity
was associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancer 
risk and was not modified by extent of family history.
IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physical
activity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history of
breast cancer.
