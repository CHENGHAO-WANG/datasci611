OBJECTIVE: To determine whether muscle invasion evident on pretreatment imaging
in p16 + oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) correlates with
recurrence.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Two-hundred and seventy-six patients with p16 + OPSCC treated at a
tertiary referral center from 2003 to 2015 were analyzed. All scans were reviewed
by a dedicated neuroradiologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neck
imaging. Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion to the genioglossus,
hyoglossus, medial pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles was analyzed. Local and
regional recurrence rates were compared between the muscle invasion and no muscle
invasion groups.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients met inclusion criteria with adequate
follow-up data and pretreatment imaging. Patients were predominantly male (87.5% 
male) and smokers (65.6% smokers) with a mean age of 56.7 (standard deviation:
9.0 years). Most commonly invaded muscles in the muscle invasion group were
hyoglossus (57.8%) and genioglossus (56.3%). There was no statistically
significant difference in primary site or nodal recurrence between the combined
group, including definite or possible muscle invasion and the group without
muscle invasion (P = 0.205 and P = 0.569, respectively). Additionally, no
statistically significant difference was present in recurrence-free and
disease-specific survival between the two groups at 3- and 5-year follow-up
(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion does not appear to be a
predictor of human papilloma virus (+) OPSCC recurrence. Additional studies are
needed to validate our findings. Level of Evidence 4. Laryngoscope, 2018.
