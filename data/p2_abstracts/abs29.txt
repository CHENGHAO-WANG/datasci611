By delivering the concept of clean hydrogen energy and green catalysis to the
biomedical field, engineering of hydrogen-generating nanomaterials for treatment 
of major diseases holds great promise. Leveraging virtue of versatile abilities
of Pd hydride nanomaterials in high/stable hydrogen storage, self-catalytic
hydrogenation, near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and photothermal conversion, 
here we utilize the cubic PdH0.2 nanocrystals for tumour-targeted and
photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided hydrogenothermal therapy of cancer. The
synthesized PdH0.2 nanocrystals have exhibited high intratumoural accumulation
capability, clear NIR-controlled hydrogen release behaviours, NIR-enhanced
self-catalysis bio-reductivity, high NIR-photothermal effect and PAI performance.
With these unique properties of PdH0.2 nanocrystals, synergetic hydrogenothermal 
therapy with limited systematic toxicity has been achieved by tumour-targeted
delivery and PAI-guided NIR-controlled release of bio-reductive hydrogen as well 
as generation of heat. This hydrogenothermal approach has presented
a cancer-selective strategy for synergistic cancer treatment.
