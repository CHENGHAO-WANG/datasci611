BACKGROUND: The indication of surgical resection in esophageal cancer is often
conditioned by patient's age. We aimed to assess the trends in utilization of
surgical treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the United States,
stratified by age groups.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Institute's
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry for the period
2004-2014. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with EAC were eligible for
inclusion. The yearly incidence of esophagectomy, stratified by age groups
(18-49, 50-70, and >70 years old), was calculated using Poisson regression.
Weighted log-binomial regression was used to compare the proportion of patients
undergoing esophagectomy, within each age group. Inverse probability of treatment
weights were used to account for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 21,301 patients were included. During the study period, the
rate of esophagectomy decreased from 34.1% to 28.2% (P = .40) in patients between
18 and 49 years old, from 38.6% to 33.3% (P = .06) in patients between 50 and 70 
years old, and from 21.4% to 16.9% (P = .04) in patients older than 70 years.
After accounting for patient and cancer characteristics, patients older than 70
years were 50% less likely to undergo esophagectomy compared with both patients
between 18 and 49 years old (risk ratio [RR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]
0.45-0.57, P < .0001) and patients between 50 and 70 years old (RR 0.53, 95% CI
0.50-0.56, P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: Surgical resection is scarcely used in patients older than 70 years
in the United States. Further investigation of surgical outcomes in elderly
patients is warranted to determine if surgical treatment is underutilized in a
large proportion of EAC patients.
