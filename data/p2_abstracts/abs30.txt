The ClinGen PTEN Expert Panel was organized by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer
Clinical Domain Working Group to assemble clinicians, researchers, and molecular 
diagnosticians with PTEN expertise to develop specifications to the 2015 ACMG/AMP
Sequence Variant Interpretation Guidelines for PTEN variant interpretation. We
describe finalized PTEN-specific variant classification criteria and outcomes
from pilot testing of 42 variants with benign/likely benign (BEN/LBEN),
pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PATH/LPATH), uncertain significance (VUS), and
conflicting (CONF) ClinVar assertions. Utilizing these rules, classifications
concordant with ClinVar assertions were achieved for 14/15 (93.3%) BEN/LBEN and
16/16 (100%) PATH/LPATH ClinVar consensus variants for an overall concordance of 
96.8% (30/31). The variant where agreement was not reached was a synonymous
variant near a splice donor with noncanonical sequence for which in silico models
cannot predict the native site. Applying these rules to six VUS and five CONF
variants, adding shared internal laboratory data enabled one VUS to be classified
as LBEN and two CONF variants to be as classified as PATH and LPATH. This study
highlights the benefit of gene-specific criteria and the value of sharing
internal laboratory data for variant interpretation. Our PTEN-specific criteria
and expertly reviewed assertions should prove helpful for laboratories and others
curating PTEN variants.
