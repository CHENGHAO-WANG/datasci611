The variant curation guidelines published in 2015 by the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology
(ACMG/AMP) provided the genetics community with a framework to assess variant
pathogenicity; however, these rules are not gene specific. Germline pathogenic
variants in the CDH1 gene cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular
breast cancer, a clinically challenging cancer predisposition syndrome that often
requires a multidisciplinary team of experts to be properly managed. Given this
challenge, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Hereditary Cancer Domain
prioritized the development of the CDH1 variant curation expert panel (VCEP) to
develop and implement rules for CDH1 variant classifications. Here, we describe
the CDH1 specifications of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, which were developed and
validated after a systematic evaluation of variants obtained from a cohort of
clinical laboratory data encompassing ∼827,000 CDH1 sequenced alleles. Comparing 
previously reported germline variants that were classified using the 2015
ACMG/AMP guidelines to the CDH1 VCEP recommendations resulted in reduced variants
of uncertain significance and facilitated resolution of variants with conflicted 
assertions in ClinVar. The ClinGen CDH1 VCEP recommends the use of these
CDH1-specific guidelines for the assessment and classification of variants
identified in this clinically actionable gene.
