BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence is significant in countries, such as South 
Africa, with high burdens of both HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical
cancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, but
there is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment,
especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smears 
followed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public health
facilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches for
treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) among
HIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at a
public HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.
METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis of 
data gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. In 
the trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN2+ and eligible for cryotherapy were 
randomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN2+ at six months as
determined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of their
original treatment assignment-received LEEP. "Cure" was then defined as the
absence of disease at 12 months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Health
service costs were estimated using micro-costing between June 2013 and April
2014. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 3%. Two different
service volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysis
were considered in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 166 women with CIN2+ were enrolled (86 had LEEP; 80 had
cryotherapy). At 12 months, cumulative loss to follow-up was 12.8% (11/86) for
the LEEP group and 13.8% (11/80) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjusted
intention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was no 
significant difference in efficacy. At 12 months, 83.8% (95% CI 73.8-91.1) of
women with CIN2+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN2+
disease. In contrast, 76.7% (95% CI 66.4-85.2) of women assigned to LEEP were
free from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were less
costly per patient randomized at US$ 118.00 (113.91-122.10), and per case "cured"
at US$ 140.90 (136.01-145.79). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ 162.56
(157.90-167.22) per patient randomized and US$ 205.59 (199.70-211.49) per case
cured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was more
efficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant.
Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity and
scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treat
approach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and cost
outcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months was 
dominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment.
However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacy
results were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity of
the participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the "right"
treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment and
providing careful monitoring of treatment outcomes.
