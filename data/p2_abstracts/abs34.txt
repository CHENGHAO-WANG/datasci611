STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to
contribute to cervical carcinogenesis, yet other co-factors that may contribute
to oncogenesis are poorly understood. Herein, we examine whether Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV), two onco-modulatory viruses, are
associated with HPV-mediated cervical neoplastic progression.
METHODS OF STUDY: Sixty patient cervical brush samples from a study of North
Carolina women were obtained. HPV RNA positivity was determined by Aptima testing
(Hologic Corporation). The level of viral transcripts for EBV and CMV were
quantified (RT-PCR analysis), and co-infection status with HPV was then compared 
to the patient's cervical cytology grade.
RESULTS: Over one third (38.3%) of the study population was CMV-positive, while
43.3% was EBV-positive. When sample data were stratified by cytology grade, 36.5%
(19/52) of normal patients, 75% (3/4) of low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL) and 100% (4/4) of patients with high-grade SIL (HSIL) were EBV
positive. Conversely, 35.2% (18/52) of normal patients, 25% (1/4) of patients
with LSIL and 50% (2/4) of patients with HSIL were CMV positive. When examining
only HPV-positive associated HSIL,100% (4/4) were positive for both HPV and EBV
detection. This suggests co-viral detection with HPV and EBV is associated with
more advanced HSIL cervical lesions, while CMV displayed no clear association
with higher grade of cervical cytology.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-viral detection with EBV may increase the oncogenicity and/or
serve as a viral marker of progression to HPV-associated high-grade cervical
dysplasia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
