E-selectin mediates the rolling of circulating leukocytes during inflammatory
processes. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European and Asian 
individuals have identified the ABO locus associated with E-selectin levels.
Using Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
data in 2,249 African Americans (AAs) from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), we
examined genome-wide associations with soluble E-selectin levels. In addition to 
replicating known signals at ABO, we identified a novel association of a common
loss-of-function, missense variant in FUT6 (rs17855739,p.Glu274Lys, p=9.02 x
10-24) with higher soluble E-selectin levels. This variant is considerably more
common in populations of African-ancestry compared to non-African ancestry
populations. We replicated the association of FUT6 p.Glu274Lys with higher
soluble E-selectin in an independent population of 748 AAs from the Women's
Health Initiative and identified an additional pleiotropic association with
vitamin B12 levels. Despite the broad role of both selectins and
fucosyltransferases in various inflammatory, immune and cancer-related processes,
we were unable to identify any additional disease associations of the FUT6
p.Glu274Lys variant in an EMR-based phenome-wide association scan of over 9,000
African Americans.
