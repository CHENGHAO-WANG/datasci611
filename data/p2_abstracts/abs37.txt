OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests the α2-adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine
may promote metastasis of cancer cells. In this study we sought to evaluate the
impact of dexmedetomidine administration on the survival of children and
adolescents with cancer.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center.
PATIENTS: Children and adolescents who had undergone cytoreductive surgery with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
INTERVENTION: Intraoperative and/or early postoperative (within 24 hours of
surgery) administration of dexmedetomidine.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable cox proportional hazard models were used to assess
the association between dexmedetomidine administration and progression free
survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).
MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. The median age was 12 years,
42% were female, and 35% received dexmedetomidine. There were no significant
differences between the baseline and perioperative characteristics of patients
who received dexmedetomidine and those who did not. In the multivariable
analysis, the administration of dexmedetomidine was not associated with PFS
(HR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.60-2.41], p = .606) or OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.35-1.85],
p = .611).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of children and adolescents who had
undergone a major oncologic surgery, the intraoperative and/or early
postoperative administration of dexmedetomidine was not associated with survival.
