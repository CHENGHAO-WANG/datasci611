Addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) has been acknowledged as an
essential objective for the promotion of both population health and health
equity. Extant literature has identified seven potential areas of investment to
address SDoH: investments in sexual and reproductive health and family planning, 
early learning and child care, education, universal health care, as well as
investments to reduce child poverty, ensure sustainable economic development, and
control health hazards. The aim of this paper is to produce a 'report card' on
Canada's success in reducing socioeconomic and health inequities pertaining to
these seven policy domains, and to assess how Canadian trends compare to those in
the United Kingdom (UK), a country with a similar health and welfare system.
Summarising evidence from published studies and national statistics, we found
that Canada's best successes were in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in early
learning and child care and reproductive health-specifically in improving equity 
in maternal employment and infant mortality. Comparative data suggest that
Canada's outcomes in the latter areas were like those in the UK. In contrast,
Canada's least promising equity outcomes were in relation to health hazard
control (specifically, tobacco) and child poverty. Though Canada and the UK
observed similar inequities in smoking, Canada's slow upward trend in child
poverty prevalence is distinct from the UK's small but steady reduction of child 
poverty. This divergence from the UK's trends indicates that alternative
investment types and levels may be needed in Canada to achieve similar outcomes
to those in the UK.
