BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of lifestyle patterns on
survival following breast cancer. We aimed to identify distinct lifestyle
patterns based on five behavior/dietary exposures among a population-based sample
of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and to examine their association with
subsequent survival.
METHODS: In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phases I/II, we interviewed 1,808
women aged 20-74 following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. We determined
using the National Death Index (717 deaths, 427 from breast cancer; median
follow-up 13.56 years). We assessed lifestyle patterns using a latent class
analysis based on five behavioral and dietary exposures: current versus
never/former smokers; low versus high vegetable and fruit intake; high and
low/moderate, versus no alcohol consumption; and no and low/moderate, vs. high
regular physical activity. We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality,
and cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for breast cancer-specific mortality
within 5 years and 13 years post-diagnosis conditional on 5-year survival.
RESULTS: We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: Healthy Behavior and
Diet (n=916); Healthy Behavior and Unhealthy Diet (n=624); and Unhealthy Behavior
and Diet (n=268). The Unhealthy (vs. Healthy) Behavior and Diet pattern was
associated with a 13-year conditional all-cause mortality HR of 1.4
(95%CI=1.1-1.9) and with 13-year conditional breast cancer-specific and
subdistribution HRs of 1.2 (95%CI=0.79-1.9) and 1.2 (95%CI=0.77-1.8),
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestyle
patterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis.
