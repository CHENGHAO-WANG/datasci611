Epidemiological studies implicate excess ethanol ingestion as a risk factor for
several cancers and support the concept of a synergistic effect of chronic
alcohol consumption and folate deficiency on carcinogenesis. Alcohol consumption 
affects folate-related genes and enzymes including two major folate-metabolizing 
enzymes, ALDH1L1 and ALDH1L2. ALDH1L1 (cytosolic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase) is a regulatory enzyme in folate metabolism that controls the
overall flux of one-carbon groups in folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways. It
is strongly and ubiquitously down-regulated in malignant tumors via promoter
methylation, and recent studies underscored this enzyme as a candidate tumor
suppressor and potential marker of aggressive cancers. A related enzyme, ALDH1L2,
is the mitochondrial homolog of ALDH1L1 encoded by a separate gene. In contrast
to its cytosolic counterpart, ALDH1L2 is expressed in malignant tumors and cancer
cell lines and was implicated in metastasis regulation. This review discusses the
link between folate and cancer, modifying effects of alcohol consumption on
folate-associated carcinogenesis, and putative roles of ALDH1L1 and ALDH1L2 in
this process.
