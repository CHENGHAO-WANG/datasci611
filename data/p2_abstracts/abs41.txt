Impaired immunity in patients with late-stage cancer is not limited to antitumor 
responses, as demonstrated by poor vaccination protection and high susceptibility
to infection1-3. This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-induced
impairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia2, whereas systemic effects of 
tumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood.
Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD8+ T cell
responses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors.
Specifically, we identify CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (CD71+TER119+; EPCs)
as robust immunosuppressors. CD45+ EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associated
extramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a major
population, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD45+ EPC transcriptome closely resembles that of
MDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanism
underlying CD45+ EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressive 
CD45+ EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. These 
findings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likely
contributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients with
advanced cancer.
