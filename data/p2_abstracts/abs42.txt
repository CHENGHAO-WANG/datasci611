BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies reported an association of the bacteria
Helicobacter pylori, the primary cause of gastric cancer, and risk of colorectal 
cancer (CRC). However, these findings have been inconsistent, appear to vary with
population characteristics, and may be specific for virulence factor VacA. To
more thoroughly evaluate the potential association of H pylori antibodies with
CRC risk, we assembled a large consortium of cohorts representing diverse
populations in the United States.
METHODS: We used H pylori multiplex serologic assays to analyze serum samples
from 4063 incident cases of CRC, collected before diagnosis, and 4063 matched
individuals without CRC (controls) from 10 prospective cohorts for antibody
responses to 13 H pylori proteins, including virulence factors VacA and CagA. The
association of sero-positivity to H pylori proteins, as well as protein-specific 
antibody level, with odds of CRC was determined by conditional logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Overall 40% of controls and 41% of cases were H. pylori sero-positive
(odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20). H pylori VacA-specific
sero-positivity was associated with an 11% increased odds of CRC (OR, 1.11; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.22), and this association was particularly strong among African
Americans (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.95). Additionally, odds of CRC increased with
level of VacA antibody in the overall cohort (P=.008) and specifically among
African Americans (P=.007).
CONCLUSION: In an analysis of a large consortium of cohorts representing diverse 
populations, we found serologic responses to H pylori VacA to associate with
increased risk of CRC risk-particularly for African Americans. Future studies
should seek to understand whether this marker is related to virulent H pylori
strains carried in these populations.
