Transition metal complexes are of increasing interest as photosensitizers in
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and, more recently, for photochemotherapy (PCT). In
recent years, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have emerged as promising systems for 
both PDT and PCT. Their rich photochemical and photophysical properties derive
from a variety of excited-state electronic configurations accessible with visible
and near-infrared light, and these properties can be exploited for both energy-
and electron-transfer processes that can yield highly potent oxygen-dependent
and/or oxygen-independent photobiological activity. Selected examples highlight
the use of rational design in coordination chemistry to control the lowest-energy
triplet excited-state configurations for eliciting a particular type of
photoreactivity for PDT and/or PCT effects. These principles are also discussed
in the context of the development of TLD1433, the first Ru(II)-based
photosensitizer for PDT to enter a human clinical trial. The design of TLD1433
arose from a tumor-centered approach, as part of a complete PDT package that
includes the light component and the protocol for treating non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer. Briefly, this review summarizes the challenges to bringing PDT
into mainstream cancer therapy. It considers the chemical and photophysical
solutions that transition metal complexes offer, and it puts into context the
multidisciplinary effort needed to bring a new drug to clinical trial.
