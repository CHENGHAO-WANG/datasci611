BACKGROUND: The majority of urothelial cancers (UC) harbor alterations in
retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway genes that can lead to loss of Rb tumour suppressor
function. Palbociclib is an oral, selective inhibitor of CDK 4/6 that restores Rb
function and promotes cell cycle arrest.
METHODS: In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC 
molecularly selected for p16 loss and intact Rb by tumour immunohistochemistry
received palbociclib 125 mg p.o. daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Primary
endpoint was progression-free survival at 4 months (PFS4) using a Simon's
two-stage design. Next-generation sequencing including Rb pathway alterations was
conducted.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled and two patients (17%) achieved PFS4 with 
insufficient activity to advance to stage 2. No responses were seen. Median PFS
was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8-3.7 months) and median overall survival was 6.3 months
(95% CI 2.2-12.6 months). Fifty-eight percent of patients had grade ≥3
hematologic toxicity. There were no CDKN2A alterations found and no correlation
of Rb pathway alterations with clinical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib did not demonstrate meaningful activity in selected
patients with platinum-refractory metastatic UC. Further development of
palbociclib should only be considered with improved integral biomarker selection 
or in rational combination with other therapies.
