Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is crucial for prostate cancer
progression and therapeutic resistance. We show that, independent of ligand,
AR-V7 binds both androgen-responsive elements (AREs) and non-canonical sites
distinct from full-length AR (AR-FL) targets. Consequently, AR-V7 not only
recapitulates AR-FL's partial functions but also regulates an additional gene
expression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than ARE
enhancers. AR-V7 binding and AR-V7-mediated activation at these unique targets do
not require FOXA1 but rely on ZFX and BRD4. Knockdown of ZFX or select unique
targets of AR-V7/ZFX, or BRD4 inhibition, suppresses growth of
castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V7 direct target
gene signature that correlates with AR-V7 expression in primary tumors,
differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poor
prognosis. Thus, AR-V7 has both ARE/FOXA1 canonical and ZFX-directed
non-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeutic 
resistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies.
