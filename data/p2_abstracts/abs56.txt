BACKGROUND: Several foods and nutrients have been linked to the development of
prostate cancer, but the association between healthy dietary patterns and
prostate cancer aggressiveness is less studied. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MED) and Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores and prostate cancer
aggressiveness by race.
METHODS: Data from the population-based, case-only North Carolina-Louisiana
Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) were used to examine the association between diet 
quality, measured by MED and DASH scores, and prostate cancer aggressiveness in
1899 African American (AA) and European American (EA) research subjects. Dietary 
intake was assessed using a modified National Cancer Institute Diet History
Questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for high versus low-intermediate
aggressive prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Higher MED scores were inversely associated with high aggressive
prostate cancer overall (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95 for high versus low
scores); results were similar for AA and EA men. A weaker inverse association
between DASH scores and prostate cancer aggressiveness was found (OR: 0.76; 95%
CI: 0.55, 1.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality, as represented by a Mediterranean-style diet or
DASH diet, may reduce the odds of high aggressive prostate cancer.
