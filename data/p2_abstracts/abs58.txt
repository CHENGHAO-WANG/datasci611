PURPOSE: Metformin has been associated with a reduced incidence of prostate
cancer and improved prostate cancer outcomes. However, whether race modifies the 
association between metformin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness remains
uncertain. The association between metformin use and prostate cancer
aggressiveness was examined separately in Black Americans (Blacks) and White
Americans (Whites).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 305 Black and 195 White research
participants with incident prostate cancer and self-reported diabetes from the
North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. High-aggressive prostate cancer
was defined using a composite measure of Gleason sum, prostate-specific antigen, 
and clinical stage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the
association between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer at
diagnosis, separately among Whites and Blacks, with adjustment for age, screening
history, site, education, insurance, and body mass index.
RESULTS: Metformin use was associated positively with high-aggressive prostate
cancer in Blacks (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.05, 3.83). By contrast, a weak inverse
association between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer was found
in Whites (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34, 1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between metformin use and prostate cancer
aggressiveness may be modified by race.
