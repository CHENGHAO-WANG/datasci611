BACKGROUND: Methods developed to estimate intervention effects in external target
populations assume that all important effect measure modifiers have been
identified and appropriately modeled. Propensity score-based diagnostics can be
used to assess the plausibility of these assumptions for weighting methods.
METHODS: We demonstrate the use of these diagnostics when assessing the
transportability of treatment effects from the standard of care for metastatic
colorectal cancer control arm in a phase III trial (HORIZON III) to a target
population of 1,942 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years.
RESULTS: In an unadjusted comparison, control arm participants had lower
mortality compared with target population patients treated with the standard of
care therapy [trial vs. target hazard ratio (HR)= 0.72, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.58, 0.89]. Applying inverse odds of sampling weights attenuated the trial
vs. target HR (weighted HR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.26). However, whether unadjusted
or weighted, hazards did not appear proportional. At 6 months of follow-up,
mortality was lower in the weighted trial population than the target population
(weighted trial vs. target risk difference (RD) = -0.07, 95% CI -0.13, -0.01),
but not at 12 months (weighted RD= 0.00, 95% CI: -0.09, 0.09).
CONCLUSION: These diagnostics suggest direct transport of treatment effects from 
HORIZON III to the Medicare population is not valid. However, the proposed
sampling model might allow valid transport of the treatment effects on
longer-term mortality from HORIZON III to the Medicare population treated in
clinical practice.
