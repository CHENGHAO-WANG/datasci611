Identification of a few cancer driver mutation genes from a much larger number of
passenger mutation genes in cancer samples remains a highly challenging task.
Here, a novel method for distinguishing the driver genes from the passenger genes
by effective integration of somatic mutation data and molecular interaction data 
using a maximal mutational impact function (MaxMIF) is presented. When evaluated 
on six somatic mutation datasets of Pan-Cancer and 19 datasets of different
cancer types from TCGA, MaxMIF almost always significantly outperforms all the
existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity. It recovers about 30% more known cancer genes in 500 top-ranked 
candidate genes than the best among the other tools evaluated. MaxMIF is also
highly robust to data perturbation. Intriguingly, MaxMIF is able to identify
potential cancer driver genes, with strong experimental data support. Therefore, 
MaxMIF can be very useful for identifying or prioritizing cancer driver genes in 
the increasing number of available cancer genomic data.
