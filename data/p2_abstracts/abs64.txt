OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to define dietary supplement (DS)
use by cancer patients and to investigate factors associated with DS use during
cancer treatment.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with breast, colorectal,
lung, or prostate cancer in 2010-2012 at the University of North Carolina
Comprehensive Cancer Center was conducted. Questionnaires were sent to 1794
patients. Phone calls were made to nonrespondents. The authors described type of 
DS use before, during, and after initial cancer treatment, source of advice on DS
use, and used logistic regression to investigate the association of DS use during
or after cancer treatment with clinical/sociodemographic characteristics and
source of advice.
RESULTS: Six hundred and three (34%) patients completed the questionnaires.
Nonvitamin nonmineral DS use during initial cancer treatments was common: any
cancer treatment (49%), chemotherapy (52%), and radiation therapy (51%). Among
patients seeking advice on DS use, 75% reported professional sources, 44%
reported media sources, and 47% reported lay sources. DS use during cancer
treatment was strongly predicted by prior DS use, followed by prior complementary
therapies' use, receiving DS advice from a cancer care provider, being female,
and higher education level.
CONCLUSION: DS use is common and persists during cancer treatment. Among DS users
during treatment, 18% used an herbal supplement, which are likely to carry
greater risk of interaction with chemotherapy agents compared with vitamin,
mineral, and other supplements. Although many respondents sought DS advice from
professional sources, the use of nonprofessional sources remains high.
