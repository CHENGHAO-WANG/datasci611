OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the epidemiology of bloodstream infection
(BSI) in oncology patients at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital
(RCWMCH), Cape Town with focus on the commonest causes, complications and
antimicrobial susceptibilities in BSI.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the
haematology-oncology unit of RCWMCH. All positive blood cultures from RCWMCH
oncology patients taken in 2012 to 2014 were retrieved to identify BSI cases.
RESULTS: From 343 positive cultures, 150 BSI episodes were identified amongst 89 
patients; 49.1% of the culture isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 41.6% were
gram-negative bacteria and 9.3% fungal. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus and
Viridans Group Streptococcus were the commonest gram-positive isolates.
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the commonest gram-negative
isolates. The majority of BSI episodes occurred in patients with haematological
malignancies (74%), in the presence of severe neutropaenia (76.4%) and was
associated with chemotherapy (88%). Complications occurred in 14% of BSI. Fungal 
infections had the highest prevalence of complications (21.4%). Three children
died during BSI giving a case-fatality rate of 2%.
CONCLUSION: BSI in our patients are mainly caused by gram-positive bacteria and
associated with a low case-fatality rate. These results are consistent with
worldwide experience of BSI in paediatric oncology.
