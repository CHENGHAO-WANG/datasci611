PURPOSE: In response to the increasing cancer burden in Kenya, this study
identified barriers to patients seeking access to cancer testing and treatment
and to clinicians in delivering these services. Policy recommendations based on
findings are presented.
METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured key informant interviews.
Purposive sampling was used to recruit 14 participants: seven oncology clinicians
and seven support and advocacy leaders for patients with cancer. Qualitative
analysis was used to identify themes.
RESULTS: Seven barriers to cancer testing and treatment were identified: high
cost of testing and treatment, low level of knowledge about cancer among
population and clinicians, poor health-seeking behaviors among population, long
distances to access diagnostic and treatment services, lack of decentralized
diagnostic and treatment facilities, poor communication, and lack of better
cancer policy development and implementation.
CONCLUSION: Kenyans seeking cancer services face significant barriers that result
in late presentation, misdiagnosis, interrupted treatment, stigma, and fear. Four
policy recommendations to improve access for patients with cancer are (1) improve
health insurance for patients with cancer; (2) establish testing and treatment
facilities in all counties; (3) acquire diagnosis and treatment equipment and
train health personnel to screen, diagnose, and treat cancer; and (4) increase
public health awareness and education about cancer to improve diagnoses and
treatment. Effective cancer testing and treatment options can be developed to
address cancer in a resource-constrained environment like Kenya. An in-depth look
at effective interventions and policies being implemented in countries facing
similar challenges would provide valuable lessons to Kenya's health sector and
policymakers.
