Background: Differential use of endocrine therapy (ET) by race may contribute to 
breast cancer outcome disparities, but racial differences in ET behaviors are
poorly understood.
Methods: Women aged 20-74 years with a first primary, stage I-III, hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer were included. At 2 years postdiagnosis, we
assessed nonadherence, defined as not taking ET every day or missing more than
two pills in the past 14 days, discontinuation, and a composite measure of
underuse, defined as either missing pills or discontinuing completely. Using
logistic regression, we evaluated the relationship between race and nonadherence,
discontinuation, and overall underuse in unadjusted, clinically adjusted, and
socioeconomically adjusted models.
Results: A total of 1280 women were included; 43.2% self-identified as black.
Compared to white women, black women more often reported nonadherence (13.7% vs
5.2%) but not discontinuation (10.0% vs 10.7%). Black women also more often
reported the following: hot flashes, night sweats, breast sensitivity, and joint 
pain; believing that their recurrence risk would not change if they stopped ET;
forgetting to take ET; and cost-related barriers. In multivariable analysis,
black race remained statistically significantly associated with nonadherence
after adjusting for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.72, 95%
confidence interval = 1.75 to 4.24) and after adding socioeconomic to clinical
characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.50 to
3.97) but was not independently associated with discontinuation after adjustment.
Low recurrence risk perception and lack of a shared decision making were strongly
predictive of ET underuse across races.
Conclusions: Our results highlight important racial differences in ET-adherence
behaviors, perceptions of benefits/harms, and shared decision making that may be 
targeted with culturally tailored interventions.
