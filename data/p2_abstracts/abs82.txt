BACKGROUND: Although social exposures have complex and dynamic relationships and 
interactions, the existing literature on the impact of rural-urban residence on
stage at breast cancer diagnosis does not examine heterogeneity of effect. We
examined the joint effect of social support, social relationship strain, and
rural-urban residence on stage at breast cancer diagnosis.
METHODS: Using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (n = 161,808), we
describe the distribution of social, behavioral, and clinical factors by
rural-urban residence among postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer
(n = 7,120). We used rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes to categorize
baseline residential addresses as urban, large rural city/town, or small rural
town, and the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results staging system to
categorize breast cancer stage at diagnosis (dichotomized as early or late). We
then used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds
ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the
relationship between rural-urban residence and stage at breast cancer diagnosis. 
We included separate interaction terms between rural-urban residence and social
strain and social support to test for statistical interaction.
RESULTS: Of the social, behavioral, and clinical factors we examined, only
younger age at WHI enrollment screening was significantly associated with late
stage at breast cancer diagnosis (p = 0.003). Contrary to our hypothesis,
rural-urban residence was not significantly associated with stage at breast
cancer diagnosis among postmenopausal women ([adjusted OR, 95% CI] for urban
compared with small town: 1.08 [0.76-1.53]; large town compared with small town: 
1.16 [0.74-1.84]; and urban compared with large town: 0.93 [0.68-1.26]).The
associations did not vary by social support or social strain (p for interaction
between RUCA and social strain and social support, respectively: 0.99 and 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should examine other potential effect modifiers to
identify novel factors predictive or protective for late stage at breast cancer
diagnosis associated with rural-urban residence.
