Cancer cells are able to avoid immune surveillance and exploit the immune system 
to grow and metastasize. With the development of nano- and micro-particles, there
has been a growing number of immunotherapy delivery systems developed to elicit
innate and adaptive immune responses to eradicate cancer cells. This can be
accomplished by training resident immune cells to recognize and eliminate cells
with tumor-associated antigens or by providing external stimuli to enhance tumor 
cell apoptosis in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this
review we will focus on nano- and micro-particle (NP and MP) based
immunotherapies and vaccines used to elicit a potent and sustained antitumor
immune response.
