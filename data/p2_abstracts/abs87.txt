The health risks associated with acute and prolonged exposure to estrogen
receptor (ER) modulators has led to a concerted effort to identify and prioritize
potential disruptors present in the environment. ER agonists and antagonists are 
identified with end-point assays, quantifying changes in cellular proliferation
or gene transactivation in monolayers of estrogen receptor alpha expressing (ER+)
cells upon exposure. While these monolayer cultures can be prepared, dosed, and
analyzed in a highly parallelized manner, they are unable to predict the
potencies of ER modulators in vivo accurately. Physiologically relevant model
systems that better predict tissue- or organ-level responses are needed. To
address this need, we describe here a screening platform capable of
quantitatively assessing ER modulators in 96 chemically isolated 3D cultures.
These cultures are supported in wax-patterned paper scaffolds whose design has
improved performance and throughput over previously described paper-based setups.
To highlight the potential of paper-based cultures for toxicity screens, we
measured the potency of known ER modulators with a luciferase-based reporter
assay. We also quantified the proliferation and invasion of two ER+ cell lines in
the presence of estradiol. Despite the inability of the current setup to better
predict in vivo potencies of ER modulators than monolayer cultures, the results
demonstrate the potential of this platform to support increasingly complex and
physiologically relevant tissue-like structures for environmental chemical risk
assessment.
