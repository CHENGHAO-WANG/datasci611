HPV vaccination rates in Florida are low. To increase rates, the CDC recommends
clinics adhere to components of their evidence-based quality improvement program,
AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange of information). We explored
factors associated with engaging in HPV-specific AFIX-related activities. In
2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 770
pediatric and family medicine physicians in Florida and assessed vaccination
practices, clinic characteristics, and HPV-related knowledge. Data were analyzed 
in 2017. The primary outcome was whether physicians' clinics engaged in ≥1 AFIX
activity. We stratified by physician specialty and developed multivariable models
using a backward selection approach. Of the participants in the analytic sample
(n = 340), 52% were male, 60% were White of any ethnicity, and 55% were
non-Hispanic. Pediatricians and family medicine physicians differed on: years
practicing medicine (p < 0.001), HPV-related knowledge (p < 0.001), and VFC
provider status (p < 0.001), among others. Only 39% of physicians reported
engaging in ≥1 AFIX activity. In the stratified multivariable model for
pediatricians, AFIX activity was significantly associated with HPV-related
knowledge (aOR = 1.33;95%CI = 1.08-1.63) and provider use of vaccine reminder
prompts (aOR = 3.61;95%CI = 1.02-12.77). For family medicine physicians,
HPV-related knowledge was significant (aOR = 1.57;95%CI = 1.20-2.05) as was
majority race of patient population (non-Hispanic White vs. Other:
aOR = 3.02;95%CI = 1.08-8.43), daily patient load (<20 vs. 20-24:
aOR = 9.05;95%CI = 2.72-30.10), and vaccine administration to male patients
(aOR = 2.98;95%CI = 1.11-8.02). Fewer than half of Florida pediatric and family
medicine physicians engaged in any AFIX activities. Future interventions to
increase AFIX engagement should focus on implementing and evaluating AFIX
activities in groups identified as having low engagement in AFIX activities.
