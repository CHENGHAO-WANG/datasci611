OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) and
α-blockers among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in relation to
prostate cancer (PCa) incidence, severity and mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective 20-year cohort study in men residing in
Saskatchewan, aged 40-89 years, with a BPH-coded medical claim between 1995 and
2014, was conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare
incidence of PCa diagnosis, metastatic PCa, Gleason score 8-10 PCa, and PCa
mortality among 5ARI users (n = 4 571), α-blocker users (n = 7 764) and non-users
(n = 11 677).
RESULTS: In comparison with both non-users and α-blocker users, 5ARI users had a 
~40% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis (11.0% and 11.4% vs 5.8%, respectively), and
α-blocker users had an 11% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis compared with non-users.
Overall, the incidence of metastatic PCa and PCa mortality was not significantly 
different among 5ARI or α-blocker users compared with non-users (adjusted hazard 
ratios [HR] of metastatic PCa: 1.12 and 1.13, respectively, and PCa mortality:
1.11 and 1.18, respectively, P > 0.05 for both drugs), but both 5ARI and
a-blocker users had ~30% higher risk of Gleason score 8-10 cancer, adjusted HR
1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.82, P = 0.03, and adjusted HR 1.28, 95%
CI 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, respectively compared with non-users.
CONCLUSION: The use of 5ARIs was associated with lower risk of PCa diagnosis,
regardless of comparison group. Risk of high grade PCa was higher among both 5ARI
users and α-blocker users compared with non-users; however, this did not
translate into higher risk of PCa mortality.
