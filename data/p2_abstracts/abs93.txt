BACKGROUND: In the SPARTAN trial, addition of apalutamide to androgen deprivation
therapy, as compared with placebo plus androgen deprivation therapy,
significantly improved metastasis-free survival in men with non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for development of
metastases. We aimed to investigate the effects of apalutamide versus placebo
added to androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
METHODS: SPARTAN is a multicentre, international, randomised, phase 3 trial.
Participants were aged 18 years or older, with non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen doubling time
of 10 months or less, and a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 2 ng/mL or
more in serum. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 240 mg oral apalutamide
per day plus androgen deprivation therapy, or matched oral placebo plus androgen 
deprivation therapy, using an interactive voice randomisation system. Permuted
block randomisation was used according to the three baseline stratification
factors: prostate-specific antigen doubling time (>6 months vs ≤6 months), use of
bone-sparing drugs (yes vs no), and presence of local-regional nodal disease (N0 
vs N1). Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The primary endpoint was
metastasis-free survival. The trial was unblinded in July, 2017. In this
prespecified exploratory analysis we assessed HRQOL using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, which
we collected at baseline, day 1 of cycle 1 (before dose), day 1 of treatment
cycles 1-6, day 1 of every two cycles from cycles 7 to 13, and day 1 of every
four cycles thereafter. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01946204.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 14, 2013, and Dec 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 1207
patients to receive apalutamide (n=806) or placebo (n=401). The clinical cutoff
date, as for the primary analysis, was May 19, 2017. Median follow-up for overall
survival was 20·3 months (IQR 14·8-26·6). FACT-P total and subscale scores were
associated with a preservation of HRQOL from baseline to cycle 29 in the
apalutamide group; there were similar results for EQ-5D-3L. At baseline, the mean
for FACT-P total score in both the apalutamide and placebo groups were consistent
with the FACT-P general population norm for US adult men. Group mean
patient-reported outcome scores over time show that HRQOL was maintained from
baseline after initiation of apalutamide treatment and was similar over time
among patients receiving apalutamide versus placebo. Least-squares mean change
from baseline shows that HRQOL deterioration was more apparent in the placebo
group.
INTERPRETATION: In asymptomatic men with high-risk non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer, HRQOL was maintained after initiation of
apalutamide treatment. Considered with findings from SPARTAN, patients who
received apalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival and longer time to
symptomatic progression than did those who received placebo, while preserving
HRQOL.
