This article begins by introducing the historical background surrounding the
volume-outcomes relationship literature, particularly in complex cancer surgery. 
The state of evidence surrounding mortality, as well as other outcomes, in
relation to both hospital and surgeon procedure volume is synthesized. Where it
is understood, the level of adoption of regionalization of various complex
surgeries in the United States is also presented. Various controversies are
weighed and discussed. Finally, various models of regionalization and proposed
alternatives to regionalization from the peer-reviewed literature are presented.
