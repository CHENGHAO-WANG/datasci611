Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) represents an aggressive histologic subtype of
endometrial cancer. It is associated with a poor prognosis, and improved
therapies for women battling USCs are greatly needed. ONC201 is an orally
bioavailable, first-in-class small molecule that induces tumor necrosis
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) independent of p53. ONC201 has
demonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity in pre-clinical models of solid tumors
through induction of apoptosis and inactivation of the AKT/MAPK pathways. Recent 
phase I and II clinical trials have shown that ONC201 is well tolerated and may
have single agent activity in high grade glioma patients among others. We sought 
to determine the effects of ONC201 on cell proliferation in USC and identify the 
mechanisms by which ONC201 inhibits cell growth in this disease. ONC201 inhibited
cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in ARK1, ARK2 and SPEC-2 cell
lines. The anti-proliferative activity of ONC201 in ARK1 and SPEC-2 cells was
associated with induction apoptosis independent of p53 via both a TRAIL mediated 
apoptotic pathway and a mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Treatment with ONC201
resulted in significant reduction in adhesion and invasion as well as inhibition 
of the AKT and MAPK pathways. In addition, ONC201 markedly potentiated the
anti-tumorigenic effects of paclitaxel in USC cells. Our results suggest that
ONC201 has significant anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects in USC
cells through both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the AKT and MAPK
pathways. ONC201 and paclitaxel are a promising therapeutic combination in USC
cells. Thus, ONC201 should be evaluated as a single agent and as a therapeutic
partner with paclitaxel in future clinical trials of USC.
