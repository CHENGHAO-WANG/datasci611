Objective: Oncolytic immunotherapy involves the use of viruses to target and
destroy cancer cells and to induce immune responses for an enhanced antitumor
effect. Talimogene laherparepvec, a genetically modified herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in tumors to induce lytic cell death, 
tumor antigen release, and the local production of granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been approved for the treatment of a
defined population of patients with metastatic melanoma. Talimogene laherparepvec
is administered as a series of intralesional injections, and specific procedures 
are implemented to minimize the risk of viral exposure. Because talimogene
laherparepvec represents a novel therapeutic modality, its preparation,
administration, and handling requirements differ from current therapies;
pharmacists have an important role in developing new procedures to incorporate it
into clinical practice. Methods: In this review, pharmacists with experience
dispensing talimogene laherparepvec, in the clinical trial setting and/or as a
commercially available product at US academic institutions, synthesized their
personal experiences through group discussions to provide insights on the
ordering, receipt, storage, preparation, administration, and handling of
talimogene laherparepvec. Results: Suggestions for patient education and
practical guidance to assist hospital pharmacists and decision makers with
implementing talimogene laherparepvec at their institutions are provided.
Conclusion: These insights may further inform the development of policies or
procedures to incorporate talimogene laherparepvec into clinical settings and
improve patient outcomes.
