Although anti-PD-1 therapy has improved clinical outcomes for select patients
with advanced cancer, many patients exhibit either primary or adaptive resistance
to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. The role of the tumor stroma in the
development of these mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors remains
unclear. We demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of the TGFβ signaling
pathway synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy but
failed to augment anti-PD-1/PD-L1 responses in an autochthonous model of
BRAFV600E melanoma. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that TGFβ pathway
inhibition promoted the proliferative expansion of stromal fibroblasts, thereby
facilitating MMP-9-dependent cleavage of PD-L1 surface expression, leading to
anti-PD-1 resistance in this model. Further work demonstrated that melanomas
escaping anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype associated with
enhanced TGFβ signaling activity. Delayed TGFβ inhibitor therapy, following
anti-PD-1 escape, better served to control further disease progression and was
superior to a continuous combination of anti-PD-1 and TGFβ inhibition. This work 
illustrates that formulating immunotherapy combination regimens to enhance the
efficacy of checkpoint blockade requires an in-depth understanding of the impact 
of these agents on the tumor microenvironment. These data indicated that stromal 
fibroblast MMP-9 may desensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 and suggests that TGFβ
inhibition may generate greater immunologic efficacy when administered following 
the development of acquired anti-PD-1 resistance. Cancer Immunol Res; 1-13. ©2018
