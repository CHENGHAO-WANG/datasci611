Your feedback was very thoughtful. I found it particularly helpful
that you thought about who my audience would be and helped me 
remove jargon (I always struggle with that). You were the only one 
who provided that perspective to me.

My only real comment back to you is that you delivered your feedback
one day late! Wish I'd had your feedback a little sooner---it would 
have helped me prepare for that presentation!
