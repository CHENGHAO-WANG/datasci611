Your project was super interesting. 
I liked your use of clustering to identify unique subgroups, 
and then how you applied the results as a color layer in figure 3. 

There was no description of the axis units in that same figure 
though, which makes it hard to interpret. 

You also use some jargon terms in paragraph 3 that would be hard
for non statistitians to understand. Because this project is intended
to be read and acted upon by community volunteers with many backgrounds,
I suggest replacing the word "Heteroscedasticity" with "unequal variance", 
and then describe why the reader should care (in practical terms).

It might help to include a histogram or violin plot (maybe as a figure 4)
to give your readers a better idea of the shape of the data 
at the time point you highlight in the text.

Good luck!
