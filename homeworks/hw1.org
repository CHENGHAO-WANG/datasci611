Try to think these problems through but don't be afraid to enter them
into an R interpreter if you want to. You still need to explain why
they produce the results that they do.

Q1: Consider the function:

#+begin_example
f <- function(x){
  if(x < 10){
     f(x+1);
  } else {
     x
  }
}
#+end_example

What is the value of =f(0)=? Why?

What about =f(100)=?

Q2: Consider another function:

#+begin_example
g <- function(){
  x <- 0;
  function(){
    x <<- x + 1;
    x
  }
}
#+end_example

And consider:

#+begin_example
h1 <- g();
h2 <- g();
#+end_example

What is the result of?

#+begin_example
c(h1(), h2(), h1(), h1(), h2());
#+end_example

And why?
