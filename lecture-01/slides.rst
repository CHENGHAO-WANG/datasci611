What the heck is Data Science?

      1. Statistics is epistemologically comprehensible.
         You begin with a model which separates the world into
         static and random effects and you estimate the parameters
         of that model. You know your priors.
      2. Data Science is more loosey goosey. Your models typically 
         have a very large number of degrees of freedom and you don't
         usually think about what your priors really are.

Consequently, Data Science is powerful but dangerous.

Goals of This Course
====================

(1) Comfort with Development Tools
----------------------------------

These are the core, but "comfort" here means I want you all to be cool
about branching out.

(2) Survey of Data Scientific Techniques
----------------------------------------

0. Data Wrangling
1. Clustering
2. Classification
3. Tree Based Methods
4. Maybe a dash of neural networks

----

(3) Software Engineering
------------------------

.. container:: twocol

  .. container:: leftside

    0. What programs and programming languages actually are
    1. How to design reliable programs
    2. How to use Git like a software engineer
    3. How to package, distribute, document, programs

(4) Ethics
----------

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: leftside
      
        1. Don't help big corporations or governments invade people's privacy
           or manipulate their behavior.
        2. Think about the bias implicit in data sets.
        3. Don't sell data science that doesn't work.
           (This one is hard because most data science doesn't work).
