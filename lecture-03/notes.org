* Programming Languages via R

Programming languages are profoundly dumb and decades of experience
has suggested that its better when they are.

The reason is that no matter how smart you try to make a programming
language it is still going to much dumber than any human
interlocutor. Thus, any smart language is going to be full of false
promises and out right lies.

Its actually bad that we call them "languages" at all because it
encourages sloppy thinking. Banish the thought.
