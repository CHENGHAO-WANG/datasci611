What I am looking for in an answer here is that the students
understand:

1. -it is a switch ellision (they don't need to use that word). That
   is, it is equivalent to `-i -t` and so the effective difference is
   that we've added the `-i` switch.
   
2. That they have looked up the documentation for the `-i` command and
   understand that it has something to do with making the session
   interactive.
