Project Proposal Grading
========================

1. Does the proposal contain a description of the dataset and some
   information about why it was chosen? (5 pts)
2. The project proposal should have 2-3 figures which show preliminary
   analysis. (5 pts)
3. Are the figures easy to understand and readable? (5 pts)
   (This is a bit subjective but can you tell why someone bothered to 
    plot the data this way? Is there a clear interpretation?)
4. There should be a list of goals which the student hopes to
   accomplish via the analysis. (5 pts)
