# Technical Requirements for Project 1

Project 1 is meant to be an exploration of a data set. The primary
goal of the project is to demonstrate that a mastery of the tools we
discussed early in the course.

Thus half the grade will depend on the following criteria (10 points
each):

1.  Is the project documented? Is there a README which explains what
    the project contains, how to locate source data (if required), how
    to build the Docker image and how to construct the final result?
2.  The project should be portable to any machine which contains
    Docker. That is, the user who checks out the git repository should
    be able to build the Docker image, connect to it per the
    instructions graded in (1) and build the products without
    installing any libraries or other dependencies (except possibly
    downloading the source data set).
3.  Is the project traceable? Can a use examine (for instance) a Make
    file and understand which pieces of code and data produce each
    figure in the project?
4.  Is the git history comprehensible? Does the repository show small
    commits which focus on individual issues or large commits which are
    hard to understand?

# Data Sciency Requirements for Project 1

40 points will be awarded based on average reviews from other class
members in the following criteria.

1.  Is there a document describing the data set and a few results of
    analysis? The document should contain about 4-6 figures.
2.  Are the figures understandable? It should be difficult to imagine a
    better way of showing the same data, particularly when the
    interpretation in the text of the report is considered.
3.  Does the paper make any interesting observations about the data
    set? It not, does it make a pretty coherent case that there isn't
    much interesting in the data set after all? A negative result
    should be conveyed effectively.
4.  Does the paper contain interesting suggestions for further
    analysis? These can be other data sets that might be appropriate,
    more sophisticated analysis, or suggestions for new experiments or
    data collection efforts?
