## Markdown is a simple document formatting language

A cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

The really powerful thing is that code can be embedded in your document!
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Not only is the code provided with the document, but the output is displayed too.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=carat)) +
  geom_violin()
```

## You can include special symbols using the `$` operator.

$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$
